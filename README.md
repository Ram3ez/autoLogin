# NITPY Auto-Login

A simple Flutter application built by [**Ram3ez**](https://github.com/Ram3ez) to help NIT Puducherry students automatically log in to the institute's Wi-Fi captive portal.

## 🚀 The Problem

Every time a student connects to the NITPY Wi-Fi, they have to open a browser, wait for the captive portal, and manually enter their username and password. This app automates that entire process.

## ✨ Features

* **One-Time Setup:** Enter your NITPY username and password just once.
* **Automatic Login:** The app detects the captive portal and automatically submits your credentials in the background.
* **Secure Storage:** (You can add this if you use secure storage) Credentials are saved securely on your device.
* **Simple UI:** A minimal interface for entering your details.

## 🏃 How to Use

1.  **Download:** Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/Ram3ez/autoLogin/releases) (or your link) and download the latest `.apk` file.
2.  **Install:** Install the app on your Android device. You may need to "Allow installation from unknown sources."
3.  **Enter Credentials:** Open the app and enter your student username and password.
4.  **Save:** Tap "Save" or "Login".
5.  **Done!** The next time you connect to the NITPY Wi-Fi, the app will handle the login for you.
